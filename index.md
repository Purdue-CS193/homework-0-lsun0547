# Leo Sun's First CS193 Homework

- I like that we're learning about Terminal, since I haven't had much experience with that.
- For the things that I already know how to do, like using Github and Markdown, I like that the class exists for anyone with absolutely no experience with anything like this.
- It's cool that the class is being taught by students. I wonder if maybe I'll be standing in the shoes of the lecturers someday.
